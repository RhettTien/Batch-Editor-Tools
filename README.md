# Batch Editor Tools

## If you need to add tags based on cards in `.txt` `.xls` `.xlsx` files, you should try this plugin.

The Add Tag feature doesn't work in real time, you need to reopen the browser window to see the new tags.

> NOTE: **The plug-in only in the windows operating system has been tested, the test text for the English language, if you edit the text of other languages, please make a backup first!**

## The first function - Batch add tags according to the specified vocabulary list.

The tag item is optional, it can make the search to the scope of more accurate, if you want to find the card does not contain the tag can be unselected.

---

## Second function - Batch Replaces(or Empty ) the contents of the specified fields.

> NOTE: **If the field contains hypertext elements such as HTML, you need to be aware that incorrect text substitution can cause display problems for your card**!

Typing `totally-all-content` in the was replaced text box and leaving the new content text box empty can be used as a **batch empty field content** function.

Typing  `this-field-is-blank` in the new content text box, can be used as a function of **batch filling fields**.

**Some problems when using:** When selecting a tag or field, the same options are changed together, this does not affect the function.
